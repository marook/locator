Introduction

locator is an emacs module for looking up keys or values in JSON i18n
files as they are commonly used in angular and other web projects.

The images in the screenshots directory show how it will look within
emacs.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements

You need the following in order to use locator:

- emacs of course
- helm

Some esoteric projects may have more than one root directory. Some
parts of locator won't work with such projects.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

`M-x locator-find-entry` will ask you for the locale in which you want
to find entries. If your files are named de.json or de-DE.json you can
type 'de' here.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom Localization Keys

By default the keys for the localization entries are the joined keys
from the lang json files. So given the following lang json example:

{
  "a": {
    "b": "a label"
  }
}

The default localization entry key constructed for "a label" is "a.b".

This behavior can be customized by exchanging the locator-key-builder
variable with your own function. See the locator-key-builder
documentation for more details.
