* replace append with add-to-list in locator.el
because the parser just extends the existing data structures. i guess
append is copying the lists but i think there is no need to.
* declare primary language and translate others
primary language should be asked first. default value for other
languages should be translated via trans application:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ trans -b -s de -t en 'Hallo'
Hello
#+END_SRC
